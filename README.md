# ECH267- Advanced Process Control

## About Course: 

This course is an introduction to advanced process control, with the main focus being nonlinear systems theory and nonlinear control. Even though the context of the course is process control, extensive knowledge of process control is not required. The only prerequisite for the course is an undergraduate control course. Topics covered include a) Lyapunov stability for nonlinear systems including converse theorems, b) design of nonlinear controllers for various classes of nonlinear systems, c) nonlinear tracking and economic model predictive control.

## Project Overview:

In this project, I considered nonlinear systems with time-varying uncertain variable and present robust controller design that enforce an arbitary degree of attentuation of the effect of uncertainty on output of closed loop system.

In particular, I examined the descriptive example given in Control of nonlinear and hybrid process systems: Designs for uncertainty, constraints and time-delays (Christofides & El-Farra, 2005).
